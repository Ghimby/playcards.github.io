          <h3>More about Concentration!</h3>
          <h2>History:</h2>
          <p>
            Concentration is believed to have originated in ancient China, where
            players used paper cards and money. The game spread to Europe in the
            16th century and became popular among the French nobility, who
            played it with handmade cards featuring illustrations of historical
            figures and scenes. In the 19th century, concentration games became
            popular among children, who played with cards featuring animals,
            flowers, and other fun designs. Today, concentration is still played
            by people of all ages around the world.
          </p>
          <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
          <p>
            The goal of the game is to match pairs of cards by turning them over
            two at a time. A standard deck of 52 cards can be used, or a
            specialized deck with unique designs or themes. The cards are
            shuffled and placed face down in a grid formation on a flat surface.
            On each turn, a player turns over two cards, trying to match pairs
            of cards by remembering the location of each card in the grid. If
            the cards match, the player keeps them and takes another turn. If
            the cards do not match, the player turns them back over and it
            becomes the next player's turn. The game continues until all the
            cards have been matched. The player with the most pairs at the end
            of the game wins.

          <h2>Tips:</h2>
          <ul id="rules-list">
            <li>
              Focus on memorizing the location of each card as you turn it over.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a strategy to remember the cards, such as grouping them by
              suit or value.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take your time and don't rush - concentrate on each turn and avoid
              distractions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pay attention to the cards that other players have turned over, as
              this can help you remember the location of other cards in the
              grid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Practice regularly to improve your memory and concentration
              skills.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Cool Info:</h2>
          <ul id="rules-list">
            <li>
              Concentration is also known as Memory, Match Match, Match Up, or
              Pairs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The world record for the largest game of Concentration was set in
              2016, with over 1,300 people playing at once.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some variations of the game use pictures or words instead of
              playing cards, such as with a matching game for children.
            </li>
            <li>
              Concentration has been used as a tool for cognitive therapy and

              in patients with brain injuries or disorders.
