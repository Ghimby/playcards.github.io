          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <ol id="rules-list">
            <li>
              The game is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards (No
              Jokers)
            </li>
            <li>
              The deck is shuffled and then divided evenly among the players
            </li>
            <li>
              Each player turns over the top card from their pile of cards at
              the same time
            </li>
            <li>
              The player with the higher card wins that round and takes both
              cards, placing them face down at the bottom of their pile
            </li>
            <li>
              If the two cards turned over are of the same rank (e.g., both
              players turn over a 6), then a "war" is declared. Each player
              places three cards face down and then turns over a fourth card.
              The player with the highest fourth card wins all the cards in that
              round. If the fourth cards are also tied, then the process repeats
              until there is a winner
            </li>
            <li>
              The game continues until one player has won all of the cards
            </li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>

          <h2>History:</h2>
          <p>
            The origins of the game War are not clear, but it is believed to
            have originated in the United States in the 19th century. The game
            became popular among soldiers during World War I and World War II,
            as it was a simple game that could be played with just a deck of
            cards. The game has since become a classic family game that is
            enjoyed by people of all ages.
          </p>
          <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
          <p>
            The game of War is a simple game of chance that requires no special
            skills or strategies. Each player starts with an equal number of

          <h2>Cool Info:</h2>
          <ul id="rules-list">
            <li>
              In some variations of the game, players can also win by collecting
              a certain number of cards, rather than winning all the cards.
            </li>
            <li>
              The game can be played with more than two players by dividing the
              deck equally among all players
            </li>
            <li>
              Some people play with additional rules, such as allowing players
              to "double down" by placing two cards face down instead of one
              during a war
            </li>
            <li>
              The game has been used as a teaching tool to help children learn
              about numbers, counting, and probability
            </li>
            <li>
              The game has been adapted into many different variations,
              including digital versions and even a board game
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Overall, the game of War is a classic and simple game that is easy
            to learn and play. Its history and widespread popularity make it a
            staple in many households and a fun way to pass the time.
